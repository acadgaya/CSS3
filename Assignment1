 I was always interested in computers, but had no idea you could have a job programming them. As a designer I taught myself HTML and CSS, but I really learned how to program at Hacker School in NYC. Hacker School changed my life - it was a risky decision to quit my job and leave Tennessee, but it paid off considerably. I think we should all take more risks like that!
